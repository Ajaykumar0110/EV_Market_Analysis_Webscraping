## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on extracting Electric Vehicle (EV) data from automotive websites using **Python web scraping** and performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to derive meaningful insights around:

- Driving range & battery capacity  
- Charging speed & efficiency  
- Pricing and cost per km  

The dataset contains **1,146 EV records**, stored *exactly as scraped (raw + uncleaned)* in CSV format.  
The notebook demonstrates cleaning, transformation, and visualization processes.
